## Description

As a Data Scientist for Hass Consulting Company which is a real estate leader with over 25 years of experience, I have been tasked to study the factors that affect housing prices using the given information on real estate properties that was collected over the past few months. Later onwards, create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.
In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.

I am required to perform modeling using the following regression techniques then evaluate their performance:

Multiple Linear Regression
Quantile Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Elastic Net Regression
I will then provide my observations and recommendation on the suitability of each of the tested models on their appropriateness of solving the given problem.
